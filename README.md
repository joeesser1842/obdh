## Current Status
In Progress

## Project Overview
This is the On-Board Data Handling module of the inspireFly Cubesat.

"inspireFly" is a student led Cubesat design team.

The main goal of On Board Data Handling, a.k.a. OBDH, is to manage the cubesat's health information while in space, and determine the next state of operation it should enter.

## Educational Value Added
This project will give students the oppurtunity to learn how to construct a system of IC's that all communicate with eachother. This process will include schematic design, PCB design, and advanced soldering to construct the physical network. It will also include extensive amounts of embedded system programming to ensure the successful operation of all the different integrated circuits.

## Tasks
1. Update the schematic with instock parts <br>
2. Review the shcematic with advisors <br>
3. Update the PCB board with the new schematic <br>
4. Review the PCB board with advisors <br>
5. Begin constructing the PCB board <br>
6. Test the board <br>
